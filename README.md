# Game: Click The Blocks
A simple web game done to practice web development concepts (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).

This is my first experience developing a project that encapsulates the three main web development concepts.

I tried to apply OOP (object-oriented programming) to the JavaScript file. But as it is my first experience with it and as I've never look at a real OOP project I don't know if the result is what it should be.

I used the font 'digital-7 mono' wich is open to freeware softwares and education process done by Sizenko Alexander (Style-7, http://www.styleseven.com).
