# Game: Click The Blocks
A simple web game done to practice web development concepts (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).

This is my first experience developing a project that encapsulates the three main web development concepts.

I tried to apply OOP (object-oriented programming) to the JavaScript file. But as it is my first experience with it and as I've never look at a real OOP project I don't know if the result is what it should be.
